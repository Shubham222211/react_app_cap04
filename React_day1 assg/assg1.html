      let q1=React.createElement("h3",{id:"q1"},"What is react?")
      let ans1=React.createElement("p",{id:"ans1"},"Ans: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets developers create reusable UI components, making it efficient to build interactive and dynamic web applications with a declarative approach.")

      let q2=React.createElement("h4",{id:"q2"},"Who made React?")
      let ans2=React.createElement("p",{id:"ans2"},"Ans: React was developed by Facebook. It was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook")

      let q3=React.createElement("h4",{id:"q3"},"What is Babel?")
      let ans3=React.createElement("p",{id:"ans3"},"Ans: Babel is a JavaScript compiler that translates modern ECMAScript (ES6 and later) code into an older version (usually ES5) to ensure compatibility across different browsers and environments.")

      let q4=React.createElement("h4",{id:"q4"},"How does Babel convert html code in React into valid code?")
      let ans4=React.createElement("p",{id:"ans4"},"Ans: Babel doesn't directly convert HTML code into React code. Babel primarily deals with JavaScript code, and React code is typically written using JSX (JavaScript XML). JSX is a syntax extension that looks similar to HTML but is used within JavaScript to describe React elements.")

      let q5=React.createElement("h4",{id:"q5"},"What is ReactDOM used for? Write an example?")
      let ans5=React.createElement("p",{id:"ans5"},"Ans: ReactDOM is a package in React used for interacting with the DOM (Document Object Model). It provides methods for rendering React components into the DOM. "  )

      let q6=React.createElement("h4",{id:"q6"},"What are the packages that you need to import for react to work with?")
      let ans6=React.createElement("p",{id:"ans6"},"Ans: There are mainly two important packages that you need to import for react this is (1)->import React from react   and 2ns is -> import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'  a part from these user can also use additional packages according to users need."  )

      let q7=React.createElement("h4",{id:"q7"},"How do you add react to a web application?")
      let ans7=React.createElement("p",{id:"ans7"},"Ans:By install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your machine.Than after Open a terminal or command prompt Run the following command to create a new React application using Create React App (a tool maintained by Facebook for quickly setting up a new React project):   npx create-react-app my-react-app    where Replace my-react-app with your preferred project name." )

      let q8=React.createElement("h4",{id:"q8"},"What is React.createElement?")
      let ans8=React.createElement("p",{id:"ans8"},"Ans: It returns a React element that can be rendered to the DOM. This function is commonly used when writing JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension for JavaScript often used with React. JSX gets transpiled into calls to React.createElement during the build process.")

      let q9=React.createElement("h4",{id:"q9"},"What are the three properties that createElement accept? ")
      let ans9=React.createElement("p",{id:"ans9"},"Ans: Type (or tag): The type of the element, which can be a string representing an HTML tag (e.g., 'div') or a reference to a React component (e.g., a function or a class).Props (or properties): An optional object containing properties or attributes for the element. These properties configure the behavior or appearance of the element.Children: Any subsequent arguments after the props object represent the children of the element. Children can be other React elements, strings, or other values")

      let q10=React.createElement("h4",{id:"q10"},"What is the meaning of render and root?")
      let ans10=React.createElement("p",{id:"ans10"},"Ans: render involves displaying React components, and root is the entry point or target DOM node where the React application is rendered")
